  <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    I just thought I would take the time to let you know how much better <strong>summer</strong> is than <strong>winter</strong>!

    <ul>Reasons why summer is <em>the</em> best season
      <li>you can go outside to play sports, take a walk, or just enjoy the wildflowers</li>
      <li>no one gets sick as often in summer</li>
      <li>the days are longer, which means you can still enjoy some daylight after you get home from work (and witness a beautiful sunset)</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>My favorite activities to do in summer
      <li>Play beach volleyball</li> 
      <li>Ride my bike on the bike trail near my house</li>
      <li>Go to outdoor concerts like this one</li>
    </ol>
