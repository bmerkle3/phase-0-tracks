  <h1>I love Summertime!</h1>
    I just thought I would take the time to let you know how much better <strong>summer</strong> is than <strong>winter</strong>!

  <h2>Reasons why summer is the best season</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>you can go outside to play sports, take a walk, or just enjoy the wildflowers</li>
      <li>no one gets sick as often in summer</li>
      <li>the days are longer, which means you can still enjoy some daylight after you get home from work (and witness a <em>beautiful</em> sunset)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>My favorite activities to do in summer</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Play beach volleyball</li> 
      <li>Ride my bike on the bike trail near my house</li>
      <li>Go to outdoor music festivals like <a href="https://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/dca/supp_info/chicago_blues_festival.html" target="_blank">this</a> one</li>
    </ol>
