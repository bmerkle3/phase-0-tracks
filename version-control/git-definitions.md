# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is the system of saving all previous commits for future reference. It is useful because you might add code that unintentionally creates a bug, and want to revert to a previous version of your program. Version control lets you jump back to a version that didn't have the bug, so you can debug by starting fresh' without losing the work that functioned without any bugs. 


* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A project typically has various features to be developed. A branch can be made for each feature, so the entire project doesn't have to get changed as the feature is worked on. 

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is a change made to a file. A good commit message describes which changes were made, so if anyone needs to revert to a particular version in the future, they will be able to recognize the version by the message. A commit gets saved on your local repo, so if you want others to be able to see the changes too, you would need to push the commit.

* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict occurs when code has been written in different branches. This would commonly happen when teams are working on a project together, and multiple people are making changes to the same parts of code. If code is attempting to be pushed, but isn't compatible with code from the origin master, the computer must be manually directed which changes to accept and which to ignore, or it must be told how to incorporate both changes proposed.
