1. What is a variable? Why might a programmer use a variable?
  A variable is a piece of information that a programmer wants to store. A programmer would use a variable so they can keep track of the information easier (they can rename it so it can be referred to/ searched for later by a name they will remember)

2. first_name = "Abraham"
    last_name = "Lincoln"
    full_name = first_name + last_name

     The computer first will save "Abraham" as the variable called 'first_name'
     Then, the computer will save "Lincoln" as the variable called 'last_name'.
     A new variable will be saved by adding the previous two variables. It will look back to what 'first_name' was, and remember that full_name will be Abraham + last_name.
     Then, it will look back to what the value for'last_name' was, and see that it has to add Abraham + Lincoln.

    It looks like there are no spaces between any of the quotation marks, so the result of full_name will be: 
    AbrahamLincoln

3. Define and give an example of when you might use the data type in a program: 
  
  * string
      a constant made out of a group of characters (usually readable letters) that are not treated like numbers. It is recognized as being the content between quotation marks.
  * integer
      a constant made out of numbers (positive, negative, zero) that don't have a shown decimal place, and can be manipulated the way numbers can be manipulated in mathematics (ie, + - * /).
  * float
      a constant made out of numbers (positive, negative, zero) that DO have a shown decimal place, and can be manipulated the way numbers can be manipulated in mathematics (ie, + - * /).
  * nil
      denotes that a value is not applicable. Has no value.
  * boolean
      a constant whose concept is either true or false.


4. What is an algorighm?
  a set of logical instructions that direct the computer on how to complete a given task
5. What are two common categories of algorithm in computer science?
  decrypting characters
  encryptinc characters

6. What is a method? Why might a programmer choose to use a method?
  A method is the rule that a computer follows to return a value. Whenever a programmer wants the computer to do something with information that has been provided, it is a method that does the action.

7. Define as they relate to a method: 

  * return value
      the 'answer'. When information is put into a method, the method runs, and the output is called the return value.
  * side effect
     when the output changes or interacts with the computer, that/those changes are considered side effects.
  * parameter
      when defining a method that will take an argument, a parameter is the word that stands in the place of where the argument will go. It is like a (hopefully descriptive) place saver
  * argument
      the local variable that a method uses to apply changes to. 
  * implicit return
      when a computer follows the instructions of a program, it doesn't automatically display the outcome of the program. When it doesn't display the outcome, it can be harder to follow as a programmer, but it usually is preferred because it is much faster than explicit returns, which would display the outcome.

8. What are global scope and method scope? How do those scopes impact the availability of data at different points in a program?

9. What is control flow? Why might a programmer choose to use flow control?

10. Define as they relate to flow control:

  * loop
  * if
  * else
  * elsif
  * while
  * until
