#initializes with attributes:
  # attr @variable can be set by first user

 #method to make a new V2 variable, which changes all letters to underscores
 # => if statement so as letters are guessed, they appear in word.
# => must save latest version (with guessed letters-- overwrite previous version)
# =>  so the letters that have been guessed accumulate.
 
 #method that compares V2 variable to the attr @variable
# => if statement that returns congratulations if user2 enters letters that equal @variable
# => # => returns taunting message if user2 can't guess within allotted guesses

 #method to limit number of guesses to length of word (loop & #length)
# =>  if statement so repeat guesses don't count against user2
# => else 'turn' counter increases by one
